**摘要**:

To provide updated recommendations for immunotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer. ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of relevant studies and develop recommendations for clinical practice. Twelve newly published or updated phase III randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The target population for these recommendations is patients with unresectable locally advanced, advanced, or metastatic gastroesophageal cancer. Results from testing for actionable biomarkers should be available as soon as possible to inform treatment decision making. Immunotherapy with doublet chemotherapy is recommended for patients with proficient mismatch repair (pMMR)/microsatellite stable (MSS) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 expression ≥1; patients with higher PD-L1 expression are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Zolbetuximab is recommended for patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 <1, and positive CLDN18.2 expression. Patients with dual PD-L1 and CLDN18.2 positivity should engage in shared decision making, considering the factors outlined in the guideline. Doublet chemotherapy alone is recommended for patients who are not positive for actionable biomarkers or are not considered candidates for targeted therapy or immunotherapy. For patients with pMMR/MSS HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, trastuzumab and doublet chemotherapy is recommended; for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1, the addition of pembrolizumab is recommended. Immunotherapy alone or with doublet chemotherapy is recommended for patients with mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability-high gastroesophageal cancer. Second-line therapy options include ramucirumab with paclitaxel, trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-positive gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, and immunotherapy for PD-L1 ≥1 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after first-line combination chemotherapy without immunotherapy.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/gastrointestinal-cancer-guidelines.

**摘要**:

We report efficacy and safety results from the CheckMate 649 trial after 5 years of follow-up. Adults with previously untreated, non-HER2+, unresectable, advanced or metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma were randomized to receive nivolumab plus chemotherapy (n = 789) or chemotherapy (n = 792). Primary endpoints were met and reported previously, with nivolumab plus chemotherapy demonstrating superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥5. With minimum follow-up of 60.1 months, the OS benefit (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.61-0.81]) and PFS benefit (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.61-0.82]) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥5 were sustained. Five-year OS and PFS rates were 16% versus 6% and 10% versus 6%, respectively. Objective response rate per blinded independent central review was 58% (95% CI 54-62) versus 46% (95% CI 42-50), and median duration of response was 8.5 (95% CI 7.7-9.9) months versus 6.9 (95% CI 5.9-7.6) months, respectively. Survival and response benefits were also maintained in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and all randomized patients. Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 60% of patients receiving nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 45% of patients receiving chemotherapy. No new safety concerns were observed. To our knowledge, these are the first reported 5-year results of a PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy continued to demonstrate long-term survival benefit and acceptable safety after 5 years of follow-up, reinforcing its use as a standard first-line treatment for PD-L1 positive patients.

## 文章 3: Immune checkpoint inhibition increases antigen-specific T cell response in head and neck cancer.

**PMID**: 

**期刊**: Scientific reports

**摘要**:

Therapeutic strategies which target immune checkpoint markers and enable the immune system to initiate immune responses against tumor cells represent a major advancement in cancer therapy. The response rate to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in head and neck cancer is about 20%, which underlines the importance of finding further immune-based treatment options. Furthermore, the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on antigen-specific T cells have not yet been sufficiently explored, therefore more detailed investigations are required. In mixed lymphocyte-peptide cultures, specific cytotoxic T cells were generated against various tumor-associated antigens. Several tumor-associated antigens such as MAGE, PRAME and NY-ESO-1 were identified as the most potent immunostimulatory agents. The immune response of those specific T cells against head and neck cancer cell lines was measured in ELISPOT assays. The influence of PD-1 and other immune checkpoints on the peptide-specific immune response was investigated with T cells from healthy donors in conjunction with HNSCC tumor cells. Especially the anti-PD-1 antibody is able to increase antigen-specific immune responses. The combination of anti-PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors, like LAG-3 or TIM-3, lead to little or no synergistic effects. Antigen-specific vaccination in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibition may therefore be a potential future therapeutic option in head and neck cancer to generate an enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Based on the study findings, an increase antigen-specific immune response by vaccinating the patient with a tumor-associated peptide in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody would be advantageous in HNSCC. Efforts into finding and developing new combination therapies should be further advanced.

## 文章 4: VSIG10L is a major determinant of esophageal homeostasis and inherited predisposition to Barrett's esophagus.

**PMID**: 

**期刊**: Nature communications

**出版社**: Nature

**发表日期**: 2026-Jan

**DOI**: 10.1038/s41467-026-68975-3

**摘要**:

The molecular underpinnings contributing to the onset of Barrett's esophagus (BE) remain elusive. By studying familial clusters of the disease, here we identify a significant association between genetic variants in the V-set and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 10 Like (VSIG10L) gene and BE predisposition. Using mammalian tissues and patient-derived organoids, we show VSIG10L is selectively expressed in the suprabasal squamous cells of the esophageal mucosa and is essential for epithelial maturation and homeostasis. Mice carrying human-orthologous germline mutations in Vsig10l exhibit loss of desmosomes, concomitant with disrupted epithelial differentiation programs, in the squamous mucosa. Upon long-term exposure to a bile acid (deoxycholate) supplemented diet, Vsig10l-mutant mice develop overt BE-like lesions in the forestomach. Furthermore, loss of esophageal VSIG10L expression is observed frequently in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, a known risk factor for BE. Collectively, our study uncovers a fundamental link between VSIG10L, esophageal homeostasis, and BE predisposition.

**摘要**:

In the era of precision medicine, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of esophageal cancer needs further insight, to identify unfavorable biology leading to poor outcomes. This study analyzed the TME of esophageal cancer in relation to clinicopathologic parameters, and neoadjuvant treatment. A series of patients operated for esophageal cancer with curative intent between 01.2009 and 12.2021 were included. Initial biopsies and surgical specimens of all patients underwent immunohistochemical analysis, to detect the immune infiltrate markers CD3+, CD8, CD163, CD68, PD-L1 and FoxP3+. The CPS score was used for PD-L1 quantification, whereas the Mandard regression grade (TRG) assessed pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). Continuous variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney-U test, and categorical ones with the Chi-2 test; paired-data tests were used when appropriate. Significance threshold was set at p < 0.05. Overall, 68 patients (82.4% males, mean age 62.4±9.4 years, 79.4% adenocarcinoma) were included. TME in smokers had lower M2-like (CD163+, p = 0.010) and total macrophages (CD68+, p = 0.001), but similar CD163/68 ratio and T-cells as non-smokers. Squamous cell cancer compared to adenocarcinoma showed lower M2-like macrophages (p = 0.023) and T-cell infiltration (p = 0.006). NAT increased macrophages in the TME, while depleting Treg/FoxP3 + cells. Poor responders to NAT had similar baseline TME characteristics as complete responders, but they displayed higher total macrophage count (CD68+) after NAT (p = 0.026). In the present series, the TME of active smokers and patients with squamous cell cancer had a significantly reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration. Neoadjuvant treatment recruited macrophages and T-cells in the TME, but interestingly, an increased macrophage count upon final histology was related to poor response to treatment. The present study provides valuable insight to the TME composition of esophageal cancer and its modification after NAT, however, further studies are needed to assess the exact functional role of TME elements, and their impact on clinical outcomes.

## 文章 6: Single-cell screens identify ADAM12 as a fibroblast checkpoint impeding anti-tumor immunity.

**PMID**: 

**期刊**: Cancer cell

**出版社**: Cell

**发表日期**: 2026-Feb

**摘要**:

Clinical trials targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-crucial pro-tumoral factors in cancer-have almost all failed. This may be ascribed to their intrinsic functional plasticity and the opaque regulatory circuits underlying their heterogeneous phenotypes within tumors. We address these by developing a systematic screening approach for patient-derived fibroblasts using complementary CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa)-based Perturb-seq. An anti-tumoral interferon (IFN)-I response-associated program is identified as the primary antagonism axis counteracting TGF-β-driven pro-tumoral myofibroblast activation. ADAM12 emerges as a molecular checkpoint mediating this relationship. Its ablation elicits IFN-I-responsive programs, reconfigures myofibroblast population structures into progenitor-like states, revitalizes T cell-based immune responses, and induces tumor rejection across various murine models. Further combined with human genomics data analysis, our findings position ADAM12 as a potential target for fibroblasts, paving the way for actionable therapeutic interventions.

## 文章 7: Multiomics identifies a cholesterol-TFEB-PLD3-TLR9 axis driving immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophage polarization in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

**PMID**:

**摘要**:

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) reshape the tumor immune microenvironment and promote tumor progression, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Through integration of single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing datasets from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we identified a distinct protumoral macrophage population with elevated expression of phospholipase D3 (PLD3). Multiomics investigations revealed that high infiltration of these PLD3-high macrophages was associated with poor clinical outcomes in ESCC patients. Mechanistically, tumor cells secreted cholesterol to modulate the microenvironment. Upon the uptake by TAMs, cholesterol triggered the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which directly bound to the PLD3 promoter region and activated its transcription. The overexpressed PLD3 localized to lysosomes, enzymatically degrading single-stranded nucleic acids, thereby suppressing the activation of the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway. This cascade ultimately impaired effector T cell function and sustained an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Notably, therapeutic intervention using ODN2216-siPLD3 in murine models enhanced CD8 T cell infiltration and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Our findings highlight PLD3-high macrophages as a promising diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for ESCC, paving the way for potential clinical translation.

## 文章 8: Progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and hyper-Treg crosstalk: a driver of immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

**PMID**:

**摘要**:

Despite the crucial role of antigen presentation in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy, its contribution and the mechanism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear, representing a key knowledge gap in overcoming immune escape in its immunotherapy. This study explores how tumor antigen presentation and intercellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive ICI resistance using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Publicly available scRNA-seq data from 24 ESCC patients treated with chemotherapy and ICIs were analyzed. Cell clustering, transcription factor regulation, cell-cell communication analysis, and KEGG/GO enrichment analyses were used to examine malignant cell heterogeneity, the relationship between antigen-presenting cells and ICI responses, and cell-cell interactions influencing anti-tumor response. Spatial relationships were validated through multiplex immunofluorescence. Malignant cells were classified by enrichment analyses into cNMF_1, cNMF_2, cNMF_3, and cNMF_4, with cNMF_4 showing antigen-presenting traits. Based on ICI response groups, cell-cell communication analysis revealed that in poor responders, the antigen presentation ability of tumors induced by treatment was enhanced, and mainly enriched in the MHC-I pathway. The crosstalk between Progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex and hyper-Treg in the TME drove ICI resistance. Hyper-Treg likely regulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T activation through the CLEC2C-KLRB1 axis, forming an inhibitory cell interaction network dominated by hyper-Treg, resulting in an overall strong immune suppression state of the TME in this population. The antigen-presenting malignant epithelial cells of ESCC exhibit significant interactions with various T cells in the TME. ICI resistance is closely associated with the crosstalk between progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex and hyper-Treg, representing a promising target for personalized ESCC therapy.

**摘要**:

<b>Background:</b> Radiotherapy (RT) remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key mediators of TME, yet how RT reprograms TAMs toward a programmed death ligand- 1(PD-L1)⁺ immunosuppressive phenotype remains unclear. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) subcutaneous xenografts in immunodeficient mice received localized RT or sham treatment. Tumor-infiltrating PD-L1⁺ TAMs were quantified via multiplex immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from irradiated ESCC cells (IR-EVs) were isolated and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Functional assays included co-culture of IR-EVs-educated macrophages with autologous CD8⁺ T cells. RNA sequencing identified DYNLL1-AS1 as the most upregulated lncRNA in IR-EVs. Mechanistic studies employed RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Clinical validation utilized ESCC specimens for RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization. Prognostic significance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. <b>Results:</b> RT triggered ESCC cells to secrete DYNLL1-AS1-enriched EVs, which reprogrammed macrophages into PD-L1⁺ immunosuppressive TAMs. IR-EVs-educated macrophages suppressed CD8⁺ T cell proliferation and IFN-γ/ Granzyme B secretion. Mechanistically, DYNLL1-AS1 bound SEC22B, enabling its interaction with FOXP1 to activate PD-L1 transcription via promoter binding. <i>In vivo</i>, EVs carrying DYNLL1-AS1 counteract anti-PD-L1 therapy by suppressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function and promoting tumor growth. In ESCC patients, high DYNLL1-AS1 expression correlated with PD-L1⁺ TAM density, poor immunotherapy response, and reduced survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed DYNLL1-AS1 as an independent prognostic factor. <b>Conclusions:</b> Radiation-induced DYNLL1-AS1 in ESCC EVs drives PD-L1⁺ TAMs immunosuppression via SEC22B/ FOXP1 signaling. Combining DYNLL1-AS1 inhibition with PD-L1 blockade may reverse RT-induced immunosuppression, offering a transformative strategy for ESCC radio-immunotherapy.

The exhaustion of T cells represents a critical obstacle limiting the success of immunotherapeutic interventions. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism offers a promising approach to mitigate exhaustion and enhance CAR-T persistence. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment disrupts energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and cell survival, impairing CAR-T function. Here, we review the current challenges facing the clinical application of CAR-T therapy in cancers and summarize mitochondrial-centered approaches to overcome some of these obstacles by optimizing mitochondrial metabolic pathways. We emphasize the essential role of mitochondrial metabolism in augmenting therapeutic efficacy and persistence of CAR-T cells. Future breakthroughs will depend on robust clinical evidence and precise metabolic modulation to enhance CAR-T therapies.

**摘要**:

The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment. Activating innate immunity in CRC treatment has the potential to reduce drug resistance and side effects. Here, we develop a biomimetic platform by utilizing antimicrobial peptide-functionalized CRC cell membranes to encapsulate a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (C), hereby called peptide-functionalized camouflage C (PfCC). When injected into tumour-bearing mice, PfCC will degrade under the acidic condition of the tumour microenvironment and release cobalt ions, which react with endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S to generate black stellate precipitates with good photothermal properties, recruiting NK cells and mitigates the immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment. Simultaneously, the degradation of PfCC will release structure-protected antimicrobial peptides, inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, and reducing H<sub>2</sub>S production. The abovementioned synergistic top-down regulation of H<sub>2</sub>S promote the polarization of macrophages and further activates the innate immune response. Moreover, experiments including the convex hull algorithm from AI deep learning of the segment anything model indicate that PfCC exhibites the most effective therapeutic effect compared with the single H<sub>2</sub>S-regulated therapeutic modality. Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.

**摘要**:

The mechanisms for failure of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (NICB), an established therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), remain unclear. We integrated single-cell RNA data from patients with ESCC pre- and post-NICB, identifying a subset of senescent EGR1-expressing B cells that correlate with poor pathological responses. EGR1 was a key transcription factor regulating B cell senescence. EGR1<sup>+</sup> B cells emerged as predictors of adverse outcomes in multiple cohorts. These senescent B cells, through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), drive chronic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the inducement of immunosuppressive TREM2<sup>+</sup> tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity and contributing to NICB failure. Furthermore, fisetin was identified as an anti-senescence drug for mitigating B cell senescence and enhancing NICB efficacy. Our findings highlight the role of senescent EGR1<sup>+</sup> B cells in ESCC immunotherapy failure and suggest targeting B cell senescence as a strategy to improve NICB outcomes.

**摘要**:

Chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy, is a standard of care for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer. However, outcomes remain poor. We aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody, plus atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, and chemotherapy in treatment-naive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer. MORPHEUS-EC is a phase 1b/2, randomised, open-label, umbrella study done at 20 sites in Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, Israel, the UK, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had treatment-naive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned using a permuted-block method to receive tiragolumab (600 mg intravenously every 21 days) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 21 days) and chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 21 days plus intavenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 24 h on days 1-5 of each 21 day cycle), or atezolizumab and chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 in patients who received at least one dose of each drug for their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03281369, and is ongoing. Between June 5, 2020 and Nov 8, 2022, 152 patients were assigned to the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=63), atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=65), or chemotherapy (n=24) groups (136 [89%] were male and 16 [11%] were female, 98 [64%] were Asian and 50 [33%] were White). Median survival follow-up was 10·9 months (IQR 7·1-17·3) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, 11·4 months (IQR 7·9-14·7) in the atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, and 8·7 months (3·9-12·0) in the chemotherapy group. Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate was 67·7% (95% CI 54·7-79·1; 42 of 62 patients) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, 53·8% (41·0-66·3; 35 of 65) in the atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, and 47·8% (26·8-69·4; 11 of 23 patients) in the chemotherapy group. 49 (79%) of 62, 52 (80%) of 65, and 17 (74%) of 23 patients had a grade 3-4 adverse event in each group respectively, and 36 (58%) of 62, 33 (51%) of 65, and 11 (48%) of 23 had a serious adverse event. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (46 [74%] of 62, 47 [72%] of 65, and 18 [78%] of 23) and decreased appetite (29 [47%], 29 [45%], and 10 [43%]). No deaths were treatment related. These results support the additional benefit of tiragolumab combined with atezolizumab and chemotherapy for patients with treatment-naive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer. Further validation of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy has been performed in the phase 3 SKYSCRAPER-08 trial (NCT04540211). F Hoffmann-La Roche-Genentech.

**摘要**:

Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Unlike conventional treatments, the targeted therapies or emerging immunotherapies have shown significant advantages in the management of advanced lung cancer. Therefore, exploring novel predictive biomarkers or therapeutic targets is still of far-reaching significance for the future treatment of lung cancer. This study revealed that low expression of IGSF10, an important member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, significantly correlates with poor overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and strong tumorigenic capacity of LUAD cells. Mechanistically, high expression of IGSF10 can inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LUAD cells via p53-triggering ferroptosis and impede G<sub>1</sub>/S cell cycle transition of LUAD cells via the p53-p21 axis, leading to suppression of LUAD cell migration, growth and tumorigenic capacity. Our findings clarified the specific role of IGSF10 in LUAD, and theoretically suggested new avenues for the presumable IGSF10-targeting therapy of lung cancer in the future.

**摘要**:

This study explores the role of efferocytosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vitro/in vivo assays. Analyzing 27 samples from 9 patients with ESCC, we identify diverse cell types and significant heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, with a focus on efferocytosis. Our findings highlight that macrophages engulf apoptotic tumor cells, thereby impairing immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Notably, TP63 and RAC2 emerge as key regulators of this process, influencing efferocytosis and immune modulation. Functional assays demonstrate that disrupting these pathways alters macrophage efferocytosis and impacts tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that targeting efferocytosis pathways offers potential therapeutic strategies for ESCC, enhancing antitumor immunity and improving patient outcomes. The study underscores the complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, with efferocytosis representing a promising therapeutic target.

**摘要**:

Extranodal involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma most commonly occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas direct esophageal invasion by lymphoma is rare. The coexistence of a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) in such cases is even more exceptional, typically indicating a poor prognosis. This case report describes a female patient with advanced-age, large B-cell lymphoma involving both the lungs and esophagus, complicated by a TEF. Following treatment, the patient demonstrated improved physical strength and nutritional status, surviving more than 15 months post-diagnosis. An 81-year-old female patient presented with a 2-month history of progressively worsening dysphagia, accompanied by cough and expectoration of white sticky sputum, along with marked weight loss and declining physical strength. The patient was definitively diagnosed with extranodal metastasis of large B-cell lymphoma involving the esophagus and complicated by TEF combined imaging studies and endoscopic biopsy. Concurrently, the patient presented with multiple comorbidities, including pulmonary fungal infection, viral hepatitis, moderate aortic valve regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. The patient received 2 cycles of standard chemotherapy, concurrently supported by aggressive nutritional intervention via a jejunal feeding tube. This approach led to improved physical strength, stabilization of body mass index, and elevated serum albumin levels compared to baseline. A 1-year follow-up plain computed tomography scan demonstrated no further tumor progression. The patient's physical strength increased and nutritional status improved, with a post-diagnosis survival period exceeding 15 months. This case underscores that individualized, effective symptomatic treatment can prolong survival and enhance quality of life in high-risk, frail oncology patients, while highlighting the critical role of nutritional support in comprehensive cancer care.

**摘要**:

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided split-course hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (hypo-RT) with concurrent chemotherapy followed by consolidative immunotherapy (CIT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). In this phase 2 trial, patients with unresectable stage IIIA-C NSCLC (18-75 years old, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) received MR-guided split-course hypo-RT (30 Gy in six fractions, repeated after 4 weeks for a total of 60 Gy) with concurrent weekly docetaxel (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and cisplatin (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicities. Between July 2020 and January 2023, 104 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 34.4 months. Split-course hypo-concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was completed in 101 (97.1%) patients, and 74 (71.2%) received CIT. The median PFS was 27.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.9-36.0 months), and the 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 76.9% (95% CI, 69.2%-85.5%) and 54.7% (95% CI, 45.9%-65.1%), respectively. The 1- and 2-year OS were 87.5% (95% CI, 81.4%-94.1%) and 65.3% (95% CI, 56.8%-75.2%), respectively. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was lymphopenia (35.6%). Grade 2-3 pneumonitis was observed in eight patients (7.7%) during hypo-CCRT and in seven patients (6.7%) during CIT. Grade 3 esophagitis occurred in three patients (2.8%), and one grade 5 hemoptysis was reported (0.9%). The MR-guided split-course hypo-CCRT delivered at 5 Gy per fraction to a total dose of 60 Gy followed by CIT yielded encouraging survival outcomes with manageable toxicities in patients with LA-NSCLC.

**摘要**:

Esophagogastric cancers are common and carry a poor prognosis. A standard option for locally advanced disease has been neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) followed by surgical resection. The primary goal of this study was to investigate whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant CRT improves pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, compared to historical controls. This is a single-institution, prospective, single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT03064490). Patients received three cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) concurrent with neoadjuvant CRT (45 Gy/25 fractions, concurrent weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by surgical resection. Patients were eligible to receive three additional cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab if they did not experience significant toxicity during neoadjuvant treatment. Pathologic response and acute toxicities were evaluated. Survival and recurrence data were tabulated. A total of 35 patients were enrolled over 5 years, with 30 patients completing prescribed neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgical resection. Eleven of 30 patients (36·7%) experienced a pCR and 15/30 patients (50%) experienced a major pathologic response. Rates of grade 3-4 toxicity were comparable to historical controls, and there were no grade 5 toxicities. Median progression-free and overall survival were numerically higher in patients who experienced a major pathologic response. The addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgical resection was overall well-tolerated and resulted in numerically higher rates of pCR compared to historical controls. Further studies with optimized patient selection are warranted to validate the efficacy of this treatment paradigm.

**摘要**:

Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) represents a global health burden, with rising incidence and high mortality. Despite advancements in early detection and systemic therapies, outcomes remain poor, especially in advanced stages. Management requires a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach that integrates surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapy, tailored by tumor histology, location, and molecular profile. For localized disease, perioperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is standard, with adjuvant immunotherapy now emerging in selected high-risk cases. In metastatic or unresectable settings, systemic therapy forms the backbone of treatment, with biomarker-driven regimens targeting <i>HER2</i>, PD-L1, <i>MSI-H/dMMR</i>, and <i>CLDN18.2</i>, offering improved outcomes. Novel agents and combinations, including bispecific antibodies, <i>FGFR2</i> inhibitors, and immunotherapy-based strategies, are actively being explored in clinical trials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving therapeutic landscape of GEC. It emphasizes the growing role of precision medicine and the integration of emerging clinical data into practice.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a highly aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy, with a notable increase in incidence over recent decades, representing a significant global health burden. The main histological subtypes are esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with the former being closely associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, and obesity, and its incidence continues to increase in Western populations. The rising incidence of EC, combined with poor survival rates, underscores the need for new therapeutic approaches. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis of this prevalent malignancy may open new avenues for optimal therapeutic strategies, with immunotherapy now central in several clinical trials. Understanding the interplay between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and disease progression is pivotal for managing this malignancy, which remains highly challenging. This review highlights the role of the TME in EAC progression and drug resistance, and recent therapeutic advances.

**摘要**:

Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has significantly improved the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC), yet accurately identifying patients' response remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce eSPARK, a multimodal framework designed to integrate routinely available clinical data for informed decision-making in nICT treatment for EC. The model is developed using 344 patients from three independent regions, each with pre-treatment-paired computed tomography (CT) imaging and pathological slides, and postoperative pathological complete response (pCR) outcomes. By incorporating cytological semantic information, eSPARK demonstrates superior generalizability, outperforming single-modality models and achieving robust predictive accuracy across multicenter datasets. Additionally, a multi-scale interpretability module identifies several biomarkers, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the tumor microenvironment, associated with nICT response. Our findings underscore the potential of eSPARK as a powerful tool for personalized therapeutic decision-making in locally advanced EC and its broader implications for advancing precision oncology through multidisciplinary data integration.
