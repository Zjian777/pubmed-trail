**摘要**:

Therapeutic strategies which target immune checkpoint markers and enable the immune system to initiate immune responses against tumor cells represent a major advancement in cancer therapy. The response rate to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition in head and neck cancer is about 20%, which underlines the importance of finding further immune-based treatment options. Furthermore, the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on antigen-specific T cells have not yet been sufficiently explored, therefore more detailed investigations are required. In mixed lymphocyte-peptide cultures, specific cytotoxic T cells were generated against various tumor-associated antigens. Several tumor-associated antigens such as MAGE, PRAME and NY-ESO-1 were identified as the most potent immunostimulatory agents. The immune response of those specific T cells against head and neck cancer cell lines was measured in ELISPOT assays. The influence of PD-1 and other immune checkpoints on the peptide-specific immune response was investigated with T cells from healthy donors in conjunction with HNSCC tumor cells. Especially the anti-PD-1 antibody is able to increase antigen-specific immune responses. The combination of anti-PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors, like LAG-3 or TIM-3, lead to little or no synergistic effects. Antigen-specific vaccination in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibition may therefore be a potential future therapeutic option in head and neck cancer to generate an enhanced anti-tumor immune response. Based on the study findings, an increase antigen-specific immune response by vaccinating the patient with a tumor-associated peptide in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody would be advantageous in HNSCC. Efforts into finding and developing new combination therapies should be further advanced.

## 文章 2: Final overall survival analysis and exploratory biomarker study from JUPITER-06: a randomized phase III trial of toripalimab plus chemotherapy in advanced esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.

**PMID**: 

**期刊**: Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology

**摘要**:

The interim analysis of the JUPITER-06 study reveals significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with toripalimab in combination with paclitaxel (Taxol) plus cisplatin (TP). Prior work proposed copy number alteration-corrected tumor mutational burden (ccTMB) and an esophageal cancer genome-based immuno-oncology classification (EGIC) scheme as prespecified biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. Here, we present the final analysis of the JUPITER-06 study and further explore potential biomarkers associated with OS. A total of 514 patients with treatment-naïve advanced ESCC were randomly assigned 1: 1 to receive toripalimab or placebo in combination with paclitaxel plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by toripalimab or placebo maintenance. The coprimary endpoints were OS and PFS assessed by blinded independent central review. Whole exome sequencing of 486 tumors enabled biomarker analyses. As of 23 February 2023, toripalimab plus TP significantly improved OS versus placebo plus TP [17.7 months, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.6-20.8 months versus 12.9 months, 95% CI 11.6-14.1 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, P = 0.002). The 3-year OS rates were 29.7% and 19.9% in the two groups, respectively. Neither programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression nor TMB significantly correlated with OS benefit. In contrast, prespecified biomarkers, ccTMB, and EGIC scheme robustly stratified patients with different long-term OS benefits from immunochemotherapy. Further exploratory analysis discovered that loss-of-function alterations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were associated with improved OS, whereas gain-of-function alterations in cell cycle and WNT signaling pathways correlated with reduced survival benefits. Importantly, CDK4/6 and PORCN inhibitors were identified as potential partners to overcome resistance and enhance the efficacy of immunochemotherapy. This final OS analysis of JUPITER-06 confirms the sustained survival benefit of toripalimab plus chemotherapy in advanced ESCC. ccTMB and EGIC enable consistently precise patient stratification, while pathway-specific vulnerabilities highlight actionable targets for exploratory combination strategies.

**摘要**:

In the era of precision medicine, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of esophageal cancer needs further insight, to identify unfavorable biology leading to poor outcomes. This study analyzed the TME of esophageal cancer in relation to clinicopathologic parameters, and neoadjuvant treatment. A series of patients operated for esophageal cancer with curative intent between 01.2009 and 12.2021 were included. Initial biopsies and surgical specimens of all patients underwent immunohistochemical analysis, to detect the immune infiltrate markers CD3+, CD8, CD163, CD68, PD-L1 and FoxP3+. The CPS score was used for PD-L1 quantification, whereas the Mandard regression grade (TRG) assessed pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). Continuous variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney-U test, and categorical ones with the Chi-2 test; paired-data tests were used when appropriate. Significance threshold was set at p < 0.05. Overall, 68 patients (82.4% males, mean age 62.4±9.4 years, 79.4% adenocarcinoma) were included. TME in smokers had lower M2-like (CD163+, p = 0.010) and total macrophages (CD68+, p = 0.001), but similar CD163/68 ratio and T-cells as non-smokers. Squamous cell cancer compared to adenocarcinoma showed lower M2-like macrophages (p = 0.023) and T-cell infiltration (p = 0.006). NAT increased macrophages in the TME, while depleting Treg/FoxP3 + cells. Poor responders to NAT had similar baseline TME characteristics as complete responders, but they displayed higher total macrophage count (CD68+) after NAT (p = 0.026). In the present series, the TME of active smokers and patients with squamous cell cancer had a significantly reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration. Neoadjuvant treatment recruited macrophages and T-cells in the TME, but interestingly, an increased macrophage count upon final histology was related to poor response to treatment. The present study provides valuable insight to the TME composition of esophageal cancer and its modification after NAT, however, further studies are needed to assess the exact functional role of TME elements, and their impact on clinical outcomes.

**摘要**:

The survival benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear, with treatment responses varying due to tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. In this phase II study, 24 patients received neoadjuvant sintilimab, albumin-bound paclitaxel, and carboplatin, with major pathological response (MPR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) as primary endpoints. Results showed a 41.7% MPR rate, with 3 year DFS and OS rates of 75.0% and 79.2%, respectively. The PD-L1 expression of all patients increased during treatment; and its post-treatment levels were more strongly associated with the response to PD-1 inhibitors than pre-treatment levels. Besides, the mass spectrometry-based proteomic quantification identified 9 downregulated proteins in responders, including immune regulation-related proteins and peptidyl-serine phosphorylation proteins, revealing the TME changes linked to therapy efficacy. Additionally, 14 differentially expressed proteins were found at baseline between responders and non-responders, with high CD44 expression correlating with a favorable anti-PD-1 response. Post-treatment analysis revealed 27 differential proteins, 10 of which negatively correlated with efficacy. In conclusion, neoadjuvant sintilimab plus chemotherapy demonstrates promising efficacy and safety. Proteomic profiling of the TME further elucidates the heterogeneity of immunotherapy responses, offering insights for precision strategies in ESCC neoadjuvant therapy. Trial registration This study was prospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000041081).

## 文章 5: Progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and hyper-Treg crosstalk: a driver of immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

**PMID**:

**摘要**:

Despite the crucial role of antigen presentation in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy, its contribution and the mechanism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unclear, representing a key knowledge gap in overcoming immune escape in its immunotherapy. This study explores how tumor antigen presentation and intercellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive ICI resistance using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Publicly available scRNA-seq data from 24 ESCC patients treated with chemotherapy and ICIs were analyzed. Cell clustering, transcription factor regulation, cell-cell communication analysis, and KEGG/GO enrichment analyses were used to examine malignant cell heterogeneity, the relationship between antigen-presenting cells and ICI responses, and cell-cell interactions influencing anti-tumor response. Spatial relationships were validated through multiplex immunofluorescence. Malignant cells were classified by enrichment analyses into cNMF_1, cNMF_2, cNMF_3, and cNMF_4, with cNMF_4 showing antigen-presenting traits. Based on ICI response groups, cell-cell communication analysis revealed that in poor responders, the antigen presentation ability of tumors induced by treatment was enhanced, and mainly enriched in the MHC-I pathway. The crosstalk between Progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex and hyper-Treg in the TME drove ICI resistance. Hyper-Treg likely regulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T activation through the CLEC2C-KLRB1 axis, forming an inhibitory cell interaction network dominated by hyper-Treg, resulting in an overall strong immune suppression state of the TME in this population. The antigen-presenting malignant epithelial cells of ESCC exhibit significant interactions with various T cells in the TME. ICI resistance is closely associated with the crosstalk between progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> Tex and hyper-Treg, representing a promising target for personalized ESCC therapy.

**摘要**:

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has emerged as a transformative advancement in cancer immunotherapy, but remains limited by multiple challenges. The exhaustion of T cells represents a critical obstacle limiting the success of immunotherapeutic interventions. Targeting mitochondrial metabolism offers a promising approach to mitigate exhaustion and enhance CAR-T persistence. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment disrupts energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and cell survival, impairing CAR-T function. Here, we review the current challenges facing the clinical application of CAR-T therapy in cancers and summarize mitochondrial-centered approaches to overcome some of these obstacles by optimizing mitochondrial metabolic pathways. We emphasize the essential role of mitochondrial metabolism in augmenting therapeutic efficacy and persistence of CAR-T cells. Future breakthroughs will depend on robust clinical evidence and precise metabolic modulation to enhance CAR-T therapies.

**摘要**:

The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment. Activating innate immunity in CRC treatment has the potential to reduce drug resistance and side effects. Here, we develop a biomimetic platform by utilizing antimicrobial peptide-functionalized CRC cell membranes to encapsulate a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (C), hereby called peptide-functionalized camouflage C (PfCC). When injected into tumour-bearing mice, PfCC will degrade under the acidic condition of the tumour microenvironment and release cobalt ions, which react with endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S to generate black stellate precipitates with good photothermal properties, recruiting NK cells and mitigates the immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment. Simultaneously, the degradation of PfCC will release structure-protected antimicrobial peptides, inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, and reducing H<sub>2</sub>S production. The abovementioned synergistic top-down regulation of H<sub>2</sub>S promote the polarization of macrophages and further activates the innate immune response. Moreover, experiments including the convex hull algorithm from AI deep learning of the segment anything model indicate that PfCC exhibites the most effective therapeutic effect compared with the single H<sub>2</sub>S-regulated therapeutic modality. Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.

## 文章 8: Targeting senescent EGR1<sup>+</sup> B cells enhances immunotherapy efficacy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

**PMID**: 

**期刊**: Cell reports. Medicine

**摘要**:

The mechanisms for failure of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (NICB), an established therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), remain unclear. We integrated single-cell RNA data from patients with ESCC pre- and post-NICB, identifying a subset of senescent EGR1-expressing B cells that correlate with poor pathological responses. EGR1 was a key transcription factor regulating B cell senescence. EGR1<sup>+</sup> B cells emerged as predictors of adverse outcomes in multiple cohorts. These senescent B cells, through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), drive chronic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the inducement of immunosuppressive TREM2<sup>+</sup> tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity and contributing to NICB failure. Furthermore, fisetin was identified as an anti-senescence drug for mitigating B cell senescence and enhancing NICB efficacy. Our findings highlight the role of senescent EGR1<sup>+</sup> B cells in ESCC immunotherapy failure and suggest targeting B cell senescence as a strategy to improve NICB outcomes.

**摘要**:

Chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy, is a standard of care for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer. However, outcomes remain poor. We aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody, plus atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, and chemotherapy in treatment-naive locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer. MORPHEUS-EC is a phase 1b/2, randomised, open-label, umbrella study done at 20 sites in Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, Israel, the UK, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had treatment-naive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned using a permuted-block method to receive tiragolumab (600 mg intravenously every 21 days) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 21 days) and chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously every 21 days plus intavenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per 24 h on days 1-5 of each 21 day cycle), or atezolizumab and chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 in patients who received at least one dose of each drug for their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03281369, and is ongoing. Between June 5, 2020 and Nov 8, 2022, 152 patients were assigned to the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=63), atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=65), or chemotherapy (n=24) groups (136 [89%] were male and 16 [11%] were female, 98 [64%] were Asian and 50 [33%] were White). Median survival follow-up was 10·9 months (IQR 7·1-17·3) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, 11·4 months (IQR 7·9-14·7) in the atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, and 8·7 months (3·9-12·0) in the chemotherapy group. Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate was 67·7% (95% CI 54·7-79·1; 42 of 62 patients) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, 53·8% (41·0-66·3; 35 of 65) in the atezolizumab and chemotherapy group, and 47·8% (26·8-69·4; 11 of 23 patients) in the chemotherapy group. 49 (79%) of 62, 52 (80%) of 65, and 17 (74%) of 23 patients had a grade 3-4 adverse event in each group respectively, and 36 (58%) of 62, 33 (51%) of 65, and 11 (48%) of 23 had a serious adverse event. The most common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (46 [74%] of 62, 47 [72%] of 65, and 18 [78%] of 23) and decreased appetite (29 [47%], 29 [45%], and 10 [43%]). No deaths were treatment related. These results support the additional benefit of tiragolumab combined with atezolizumab and chemotherapy for patients with treatment-naive, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer. Further validation of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy has been performed in the phase 3 SKYSCRAPER-08 trial (NCT04540211). F Hoffmann-La Roche-Genentech.

**摘要**:

There is an unmet need for additional and more efficacious therapies for patients with unresectable metastatic oesophageal cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding tiragolumab and atezolizumab to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The SKYSCRAPER-08 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 67 centres in mainland China, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with treatment-naive, unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel [175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>] and cisplatin [60-80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>]) or placebo and chemotherapy through intravenous infusion for six 21-day cycles. The primary outcomes were independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned patients, regardless of whether they received any study treatment). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04540211, and is ongoing. Between Oct 30, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, 461 patients were assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=229) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=232); 406 (88%) were male and 55 (12%) female, and all patients were Asian. Median survival follow-up was 12·6 months (IQR 6·8-18·0). Median independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival (cutoff June 15, 2022) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group was 6·2 months (95% CI 5·7-7·2) versus 5·4 months (95% CI 4·4-5·5) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·45-0·70; p<0·0001). Median overall survival (cutoff Feb 13, 2023) was 15·7 months (95% CI 13·3-20·4) and 11·1 months (95% CI 9·6-13·6; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·88; p=0·0024). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group versus the placebo and chemotherapy group were white blood cell count decrease (46 [20%] of 228 vs 35 [15%] of 227), neutrophil count decrease (78 [34%] vs 78 [34%]), and anaemia (19 [8%] vs 24 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 94 (41%) of 228 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group and 89 (39%) of 227 in the placebo and chemotherapy group; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia (17 [7%] of 228 and 13 [6%] of 227). Treatment-related deaths occurred in six patients (3%) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group (immune-mediated lung disease, pneumonitis, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, and bacterial pneumonia) and two (1%) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (gastrointestinal infection and death of unknown cause). No new safety signals were identified. Independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group compared with chemotherapy alone for unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These data support the rationale for exploring dual checkpoint inhibition added to chemotherapy for this group of patients with a high unmet need. F Hoffmann-La Roche-Genentech.

**摘要**:

This study aims to evaluate whether initiating naso-jejunal enteral nutrition within 24 hours after radical esophagectomy shortens the time to first bowel sound, first oral intake, and first defecation. It also investigates whether it improves early postoperative nutritional markers without adversely affecting albumin levels, and whether it enhances cellular immunity, thereby mediating the impact of protein intake on gastrointestinal recovery. A total of 90 patients undergoing radical esophageal cancer surgery at The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University from January 2019 to June 2021 were randomly divided into 2 groups: intervention (n = 45) and control (n = 45). The control group received routine postoperative care, while the intervention group received early nutritional therapy combined with comprehensive nursing interventions. Key indicators, including gastrointestinal function recovery, nutritional status (transferrin, prealbumin, and albumin levels), immune function (CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+/CD8 + ratios), and complications, were monitored and analyzed. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the intervention shortened mean time to first bowel sound by 1.26 days (2.07 ± 0.77 vs 3.33 ± 0.98 days), to first oral intake by 1.28 days (2.76 ± 0.79 vs 4.04 ± 0.74 days) and to first defecation by 1.54 days (3.24 ± 0.74 vs 4.78 ± 0.60 days); all P < .001. Post-care transferrin rose by 1.42 g/L (33.28 ± 4.31 vs 31.86 ± 3.38 g/L) and pre-albumin by 0.76 mg/dL (46.30 ± 4.16 vs 45.54 ± 4.17 mg/dL), while albumin remained unchanged (P = .865). CD4 + counts increased by 4.16 %, CD8 + counts decreased by 4.63 %, and the CD4+/CD8 + ratio improved by 0.22 (2.00 ± 0.26 vs 1.78 ± 0.16, P = .004). The CD4+/CD8 + ratio mediated 9.1 % of the effect of protein intake on defecation time. The incidence of complications was lower in the intervention group (P < .05). Early enteral nutritional support combined with comprehensive nursing interventions significantly improves quantifiable clinical, nutritional, and immune outcomes, accelerating gastrointestinal recovery and underscoring the value of integrating targeted nutritional support into postoperative care.

**摘要**:

Esophagogastric cancers are common and carry a poor prognosis. A standard option for locally advanced disease has been neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) followed by surgical resection. The primary goal of this study was to investigate whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant CRT improves pathologic complete response (pCR) rates, compared to historical controls. This is a single-institution, prospective, single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT03064490). Patients received three cycles of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) concurrent with neoadjuvant CRT (45 Gy/25 fractions, concurrent weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by surgical resection. Patients were eligible to receive three additional cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab if they did not experience significant toxicity during neoadjuvant treatment. Pathologic response and acute toxicities were evaluated. Survival and recurrence data were tabulated. A total of 35 patients were enrolled over 5 years, with 30 patients completing prescribed neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgical resection. Eleven of 30 patients (36·7%) experienced a pCR and 15/30 patients (50%) experienced a major pathologic response. Rates of grade 3-4 toxicity were comparable to historical controls, and there were no grade 5 toxicities. Median progression-free and overall survival were numerically higher in patients who experienced a major pathologic response. The addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgical resection was overall well-tolerated and resulted in numerically higher rates of pCR compared to historical controls. Further studies with optimized patient selection are warranted to validate the efficacy of this treatment paradigm.

**摘要**:

Gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) represents a global health burden, with rising incidence and high mortality. Despite advancements in early detection and systemic therapies, outcomes remain poor, especially in advanced stages. Management requires a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach that integrates surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapy, tailored by tumor histology, location, and molecular profile. For localized disease, perioperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is standard, with adjuvant immunotherapy now emerging in selected high-risk cases. In metastatic or unresectable settings, systemic therapy forms the backbone of treatment, with biomarker-driven regimens targeting <i>HER2</i>, PD-L1, <i>MSI-H/dMMR</i>, and <i>CLDN18.2</i>, offering improved outcomes. Novel agents and combinations, including bispecific antibodies, <i>FGFR2</i> inhibitors, and immunotherapy-based strategies, are actively being explored in clinical trials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving therapeutic landscape of GEC. It emphasizes the growing role of precision medicine and the integration of emerging clinical data into practice.

**摘要**:

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a highly aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy, with a notable increase in incidence over recent decades, representing a significant global health burden. The main histological subtypes are esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with the former being closely associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, and obesity, and its incidence continues to increase in Western populations. The rising incidence of EC, combined with poor survival rates, underscores the need for new therapeutic approaches. A deeper understanding of the molecular basis of this prevalent malignancy may open new avenues for optimal therapeutic strategies, with immunotherapy now central in several clinical trials. Understanding the interplay between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and disease progression is pivotal for managing this malignancy, which remains highly challenging. This review highlights the role of the TME in EAC progression and drug resistance, and recent therapeutic advances.

**摘要**:

Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has significantly improved the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC), yet accurately identifying patients' response remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce eSPARK, a multimodal framework designed to integrate routinely available clinical data for informed decision-making in nICT treatment for EC. The model is developed using 344 patients from three independent regions, each with pre-treatment-paired computed tomography (CT) imaging and pathological slides, and postoperative pathological complete response (pCR) outcomes. By incorporating cytological semantic information, eSPARK demonstrates superior generalizability, outperforming single-modality models and achieving robust predictive accuracy across multicenter datasets. Additionally, a multi-scale interpretability module identifies several biomarkers, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the tumor microenvironment, associated with nICT response. Our findings underscore the potential of eSPARK as a powerful tool for personalized therapeutic decision-making in locally advanced EC and its broader implications for advancing precision oncology through multidisciplinary data integration.

**摘要**:

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based regimens are the first-line standard of care for most patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The efficacy of these treatments often depend on PD-L1 expression levels. Overall survival (OS) has traditionally been the primary endpoint for evaluating treatment efficacy. Through a meta-analysis, we investigated whether progression-free survival (PFS) is a valid surrogate for OS in the ICIs-era, overall and across different PD-L1 subgroups. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published by 30/06/2025. Trial-level surrogacy of PFS for OS was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient (R) and weighted linear regression, calculating the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>). Eighteen eligible RCTs were evaluated. Regarding GEA, the correlation between treatment effects on PFS and on OS was moderate in the overall population (R=0.82; R<sup>2</sup>=0.52) and in the CPS≥ 1 subgroup (R=0.81; R<sup>2</sup>=0.66), moderate yet non-significant in the CPS< 1 subgroup (R=0.67; R<sup>2</sup>=0.51), and strong in the CPS≥ 5 subgroup (R=0.77; R<sup>2</sup>=0.85). In ESCC, the correlation in the overall population was weak (R=0.64; R<sup>2</sup>=0.47). No improvement of the correlation was found in the subgroup of patients with CPS≥ 10 (R=0.33; R<sup>2</sup>=0.16) or TPS≥ 1 % (R=0.40, R<sup>2</sup>=0.005). While the correlation between treatment effects on PFS and OS was weak in ESCC, it was moderate in PD-L1-low GEA, and good in PD-L1-high GEA. Therefore, PFS is an adequate co-primary endpoint in future trials investigating novel ICIs-based regimens in GEA, especially if the analyses are pre-planned in PD-L1-high subgroups.

**摘要**:

The potential for immunotherapy in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) is recently confirmed. To report the 3-year follow-up data are aimed from a novel clinical trial. This is a prospective single-arm phase II trial. Patients with LAGC received neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus SOX before surgery. Biopsies are obtained before treatment, and tumor samples post-treatment underwent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Spatial transcriptomics is conducted for validation. Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis are applied. A total of 49 patients are enrolled, and the median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are not achieved. The 3-year PFS and OS rates are 64.1% and 73.2%, respectively. scRNA-seq of 22, 248 cells from tumors from seven patients with LAGC enabled annotation of three cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotypes. Spatial transcriptomics of gastric cancer samples validate the classification, showing inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) negatively correlated with immunotherapy efficacy. Patients with LAGC show a favorable prognosis after neoadjuvant tislelizumab plus SOX treatment. CAF heterogeneity is crucial for patients with gastric cancer undergoing immunotherapy, and iCAFs is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment during PD-1 blockade with SOX therapy and validated by in vitro experiments. Patients with LAGC with higher iCAF scores are resistant to SOX PD-1 blockade.

3.  **研究方法**: 患者接受新辅助治疗（替雷利珠单抗+SOX）后手术。收集治疗前活检和术后肿瘤样本，使用单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）分析细胞图谱，并通过空间转录组学进行验证。生存分析采用Cox回归模型和Kaplan-Meier法。
4.  **临床意义**: 该研究证实了新辅助免疫联合化疗在局部晚期胃癌中的长期疗效潜力。更重要的是，它揭示了肿瘤微环境中CAF的异质性，特别是iCAFs可作为预测PD-1抑制剂疗效的潜在生物标志物，为未来克服免疫治疗耐药提供了新的研究方向。

**摘要**:

The standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgery or definitive radiotherapy, but clinical results are unsatisfactory. In recent years, relevant studies have shown that immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy has become a new treatment option for locally advanced ESCC. This article summarizes the current progress of chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced ESCC, and provides necessary theoretical basis for the comprehensive understanding and optimization of chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy regimens for ESCC.
